## Project Deliverables

Students are expected to develop an open-source codebase, a preliminary prototype demo by the end of CSc 59866-E, and a research report documenting results. Projects will be continued in CSc 59867 (Senior Project II) to advance to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2–4.

More details will be provided as the course progresses.
